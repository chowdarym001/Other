At Rasmussen, students have a choice in their learning. Since you know how you learn best, we offer options, backing them up with student services to help along the way. Based on your program, you can learn in online courses, traditional classrooms, at your own pace or following an instructor’s set schedule. Courses can include hands-on experience in virtual labs, project assessments and interactive sessions with experienced faculty. This flexibility helps each of our students have the college experience that’s best for them.
